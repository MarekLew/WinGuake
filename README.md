# WinGuake
A Windows-oriented version of the popular Guake Terminal for Linux. Check out the original Linux version here: https://github.com/Guake/guake/
# Prerequisites
Eventually I will make a pre-compiled version for those who want to not need these requirements, but is currently not complete. Currently, you need a working version of Python 3.x (Python 2.x is untested) installed and added to PATH, have AutoHotKey (Found here: https://autohotkey.com/) installed, and the latest version of PyWin32 (Found here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/).
